•  What does fast-forward in git mean? 
Git fast-forward is the process to merge main branch(source branch) with changes introduced in a feature branch(target branch) when there is direct linear path between source and target branch. This process helps to save time and increase speed because no extra merge commit is created. This also keeps the commit history clean.


•  Why should you have different branches? 
Having different branches promotes team collaboration on a project. Each engineer can work on their own features without altering the main source code(master branch).


•  In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have? 
More than one.
